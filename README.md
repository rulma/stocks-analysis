# stocks-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Background

We have created a workbook with VBA macros capable of calculating the total daily volume and year end return for every unique stock ticker.  In this project our goal is to refactor our existing VBA macro so that it runs more efficiently. We will asses the different solutions and challenges we ran into when refactoring our code.

### Purpose

Refactoring code is an extremely important skill. Often times the first iteration of a solution is not always the most efficient or user friendly. Our goal is to streamline our program. Since currently we only are looking at dozen stock tickers we want to make our code more robust and able to handle hundreds if not thousands of different tickers. Throughout or refactoring process we will compare run times to determine if our refactoring is effective or not. These run times are store in the Resources folder.

### Summary

Refactoring is something that every programmer will need to do at some point throughout their carreer. There can be both advantages and disadvantages when refactoring a piece or all of a code base. 

#### Advantages to Refactoring in General

When solving problems through code, our first solution is rarely if ever perfect. Refactoring provides us with an opportunity to move and develop quickly. We are able to release and push hot fixes to problems we are trying to solve while having the ability to go back and refine them after release. This level of flexibility allows organizations of all sizes to implement change fast and effectively. The faster a company can respond to the challenges it faces then the more productive and adaptive their product/services can be.

A company that is able to quickly change and adjust to the changing forces around them allows them to withstand changes that may have put them out of business otherwise. 

Refactoring is also an excellent way for an organization to train new engineers or developers on their respective code bases. Well documented code allows for new developers to familiarize themselves with the existing code base without requiring them to develop something from scratch.
